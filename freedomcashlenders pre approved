Would you date someone who takes out an online payday loan to pay for dinner? How would you feel about someone who is going through bankruptcy? Does it matter what a person's finances are when you are dating? What do financial situations tell about a person who you may consider to be a life long partner? Is the topic of finance a make or break kind of deal when looking for love?

What kinds of conversations can you have with a potential partner who would not cross the line of interference? What would happen if you did not have a financial conversation then found out later that your partner was in debt? Is debt a reason to end a serious relationship?

There are different types of debt. Medical and student loan debt both accrue quickly and can leave a person deep in debt without negative reputation of irresponsibility. It is difficult to condemn a person when something unpreventable created the debt or effort put into building a better future with higher education is the cause. Some people might fear that this debt would prevent a certain lifestyle. One thing for sure is that men and women are different in their views towards money.
